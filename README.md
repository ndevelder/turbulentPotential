Turbulent Potential Turbulence Model for FOAM/OpenFOAM

The Turbulent Potential (TP) turbulence model of Perot et. al is implemented for use in  FOAM/OpenFOAM.  TP is a four equation RANS model that can be considered a good balance between computational cost and increased capturing of the physics of the problem.
